# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my code for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). All solutions are in rust. 

## Project Structure
The solution for each day is named `day<n><part>.rs` in [src/bin](src/bin).

To run the code for day 1 part 1, use

```shell
cargo run --bin day1a
```
